In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.
Whisk in the milk and vegetable oil until all ingredients are combined and batter has no clumps.
Pour batter into a microwave-safe mug. Mine was a 14-ounce mug. You want enough head space for the cake to rise without pouring over.
Add chocolate spread in the middle of the batter with mini chocolate chips.


Your meal is prepared!!!
